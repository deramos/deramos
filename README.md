# Hi there 👋 

Hi, I'm Chidera Mosanya. I build scalable software systems and enjoy working with machine learning, particularly when it comes to deploying ML models in production. I've spent the last decade working on everything from high-throughput microservices to data pipelines, with a soft spot for crafting mobile apps in React Native.
