# Hi there 👋 

I'm Chidera Mosanya, a Lead/Senior Software Engineer with over a decade of experience in cutting-edge software engineering. I specialize in machine learning systems, MLOps, microservice architecture, and data engineering pipelines. I thrive on building low-latency systems that serve millions of requests per second, provide real-time ML inference, and process petabytes of data. I also love developing beautiful UIs in React Native
